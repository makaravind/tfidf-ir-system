  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In late 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan, China. The various ways that&#xD;
      humans will recover from COVID-19 infections is just starting to be observed and it is clear&#xD;
      there will be a wide range of convalescent experiences. This phased protocol is designed to&#xD;
      observe and study the convalescence and recoveries from acute COVID-19 infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase A Surveying (Phase A) will enable people in the community that are convalescing from&#xD;
      COVID-19 infections to be studied using telephone interviews and internet-based&#xD;
      questionnaires. The objective of Phase A Surveying is to observe and describe the range of&#xD;
      medical syndromes that occur in the wake of an acute COVID-19 infection. Participants are&#xD;
      required to be within the first six months of their recovery and have documentation of a&#xD;
      positive laboratory test for COVID-19. The data collected during Phase A will inform the&#xD;
      nature of the patient populations to be evaluated in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase B Evaluation (Phase B) will allow surveyed participants of research interest from Phase&#xD;
      A to be invited to the NIH Clinical Center for a medical evaluation and to undergo a panel of&#xD;
      standard research measurements. Each participant would be medically and psychologically&#xD;
      characterized to best understand if their complaints can be attributed to known disorders.&#xD;
      The observations made during Phase B will provide first insights into the range and character&#xD;
      of the post-COVID-19 syndromes. Individuals found to have disorders being studied within the&#xD;
      Division of Intermural Research at NIH will be appropriately referred. The data collected&#xD;
      during Phase B will identify patient populations that may benefit from deep phenotyping&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluated individuals of research interest may be invited back to the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
      from broad and deep research measurement during Phase C Deep Phenotyping (Phase C). The deep&#xD;
      phenotyping methods employed will be synchronized with other NIH-approved deep phenotyping&#xD;
      protocols to foster cross-phenotype comparison research with other medical syndromes, such as&#xD;
      Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Gulf War Illness. Deep phenotyping&#xD;
      characterizations would be used to generate scientific hypotheses for testing in future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluated individuals with Post-COVID-19 syndromes of research interest may be invited to&#xD;
      participate in Phase D Longitudinal Evaluation phase (Phase D). This would enable the&#xD;
      observation of the natural history of Post-COVID convalescence and allow for exploration of&#xD;
      the biological mechanisms underlying successful recovery and how recovery can go awry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous epidemics have created unique medical syndromes in the past. It seems possible that&#xD;
      an unique POST-COVID 19 Syndrome or Syndromes may manifest from the global pandemic. If so,&#xD;
      data from this protocol may be used to define the nature of any Post-COVID 19 Syndromes. If&#xD;
      warranted, a Criteria Development phase will develop data-driven research consensus criteria&#xD;
      for any Post-COVID 19 Syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this protocol will provide novel insights into COVID-19 convalescence and its&#xD;
      potential outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current version of the protocol provides the details for Phase A of the study only.&#xD;
      Additional phases will be detailed in planned protocol Amendments.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;

&#xD;
      Phase A: The number and severity of persistent symptoms associated with COVID-19&#xD;

      Phase A: 1000 adults who are within six months of their convalescence from an acute&#xD;
